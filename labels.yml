# Altworth Markets - Organization Labels
# =======================================
# Synced to all repos via .github/workflows/sync-labels.yml
#
# PHILOSOPHY:
#   - Labels categorize, Projects manage workflow
#   - Fewer labels = faster decisions
#   - Auto-apply when possible (conventional commits)
#   - Every label must have a clear purpose
#
# WORKFLOW:
#   1. Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
#   2. Release-drafter auto-applies matching labels
#   3. Labels drive changelog generation
#   4. Priority/Status/Size managed in GitHub Projects
#
# Total: 13 labels (down from 50+)

# ============================================
# AUTO-APPLIED: Conventional Commits → Labels
# ============================================
# These are applied automatically by release-drafter
# based on PR title prefixes (feat:, fix:, etc.)
