# Organization-wide label configuration
# Synced to all repos via github-label-sync
# Source of truth: altworth-markets/.github/labels.yml
#
# Usage:
#   1. Edit this file to add/modify/remove labels
#   2. Push to main branch
#   3. Workflow auto-syncs to all repos
#   4. Manual sync: Actions > Sync Organization Labels > Run workflow
#
# NOTE: Priority, Status, and Size are managed via GitHub Projects custom fields,
# NOT labels. This avoids duplication between labels and project board metadata.
# See: https://github.com/orgs/altworth-markets/projects/5/settings/fields
